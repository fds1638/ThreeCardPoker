    <h1>Three Card Poker Simulation</h1>
<p>
  This repo hosts a simple three card poker simulation, along with some unit tests. 
  
  <h3>The Game:</h3>
The poker itself is very very simple:
  There is a three-card deck, with a King, Queen, and Jack. There are two players. The ante for each round is one chip.
  After the cards are dealt, there is only one round of betting. A round proceeds as follows:
  <ol>
  <li>Player One decides whether to bet or pass. If Player One passes, Player Two takes the pot (a net gain of one).</li>
  <li>If Player One bet on the last step, Player Two decides whether to pass or call. If Player Two passes, Player One takes the pot (a net gain of one).</li>
  <li>If neither player passes, then they show their cards and the higher card takes the pot (a net gain of two).</li>
</ol>
    The <a href="https://github.com/fds1638/ThreeCardPoker/blob/db253f835aa7c95df961a816789330ed27151cb1/players/player.py#L10">method which determines the player's actions</a> depends on randomization
    in the case of Player One holding a Jack or Player Two holding a Queen: in each case the player bets with probability one-third.
    
   
      <h3>The Game:</h3>

    <h3>Input from a config file:</h3>
    The input is from a <a href="https://github.com/fds1638/ThreeCardPoker/blob/master/config/config.json">json config file</a> (using <code>kwargs</code> is not really necessary but convenient):<br>
  <textarea rows="15"    cols="55">
  {
    "game": {
        "rounds": 4,
        "ante": 1,
        "bet": 1
    },
    "player1": {
        "name": "Alice",
        "amount": 20
    },
    "player2": {
        "name": "Bob",
        "amount": 10
    }
}
  </textarea>
<br><h3>Output:</h3>
    In this case the code will simulate four 
    <a href="https://github.com/fds1638/ThreeCardPoker/blob/master/runner/gamerunner.py">rounds of the game</a>, giving the following output:<br>
  <textarea rows="18"    cols="55">
  Alice drew J and Bob drew Q
  Alice folded
  Alice has 19 and Bob has 11

  Alice drew J and Bob drew Q
  Alice bet
  Bob folded
  Alice has 20 and Bob has 10

  Alice drew Q and Bob drew J
  Alice bet
  Bob folded
  Alice has 21 and Bob has 9

  Alice drew Q and Bob drew K
  Alice bet
  Bob bet
  Alice has 19 and Bob has 11

    <br><h3>Unit Testig with <code>unittest</code> and GitHub Actions:</h3>
    A <a href="https://github.com/fds1638/ThreeCardPoker/blob/master/tests/test_certain_game.py">unit test</a> where Player One ("Alice") draws a Queen and Player Two ("Bob") draws a King is set up, because that is the only draw for which we know
    exactly what they will do every time (both of them will bet). The <code>mock</code> library is imported to override the random output of the draw:<br>
   <textarea rows="1"    cols="55">
     <code>mock_deal_cards.return_value = 'Q', 'K'</code>
  </textarea><br>
    A GitHub action runs automatically on each <code>push</code> to the repo, with the yaml file being mostly default boilerplate but with the last
    five lines running the substance of the unit test:<br>
  <textarea rows="5"    cols="55">
        - name: Test with unittest
      run: |
        pip install mock
        pip install numpy
        python3 -m unittest discover
